# Programming
 
Draft and schedule the relevant topics for "Programming" and closely related series.

## Discrete Math I (Beginner)

1. **Intro.** Warmup with logic, numbers, etc.
2. **Sets.** Introduction to Set Theory.
3. **Booleans.** Introduction to Boolean Algrebra. 
3. **Functions.** Relations and Functions. 

## Programming I (Beginner)

### Includes

1. **Intro.** Calculations. Practise math functions and operators.
2. **Variables.** Get a concept. Practise more realistic calculations.
3. **Booleans.** Practise arguably the most characteristic programming type.
4. **Conditions.** Boolean-based statements & expressions. Practise and compare different conditionals.
5. **Collections.** Compound values. Practise arrays and objects and compare them.
6. **Loops.** Collection-related statements. Practise and compare different loops.
7. **Strings.** Another collection type. Use conditions and loops to handle strings.
8. **Functions.** The most important software abstraction. Practise all of the above.
9. **Immutability.** In contrast to Mutability. Yield first patterns and "best practices".

### Excludes

- **Types:** highly language-specific, need another course series as JS does not fit
- **Scoping:** later, basic scoping is given in Functions, advanced – togeher with Closures
- **Recursions:** later, not necessary from the start in JS
- **Regular expressions:** later, not necessary, can copy-paste for a while
- **Binary numbers:** later, not necessary for beginners (really!)
- **Statements and expressions:** later, too formal
- **Map / Filter / Reduce:** later, too advanced

## Programming II (Advanced)

### Includes

- **Binary Numbers** ??
- **Regular expressions** ??
- **First class objects** ??
- **Recursions** ??
- **Scoping and closures** ??
- **Basic FP** (map, filter, reduce) ??
- **Error handling** ??
- **Notations (prefix vs infix)** ??
- **More datastructures** (sets, lists, trees, queues) ??

## Programming III (Competent)

### Includes

- **Expression problem** (FP vs OOP) ??
- **Functors, Applicatives, Monads** ??
- **Lazy evaluation** ??
- **Lenses** ??
- **Dynamic programming** ??
- **Minimax** ??

## Programming IV (Expert)

### Includes

- **Traversals, Zippers** ??
- **Advanced algorithms** ??
- **Recursion schemes** ??
- **Parsers and DSLs** ??
- **Parallel computations** ??
- **Distributed computations** ??

## Under consideration

- **Modules** – language specific, better covered by JS series (and, oh boy, JS has *many*)
- **Types** – language specific, better covered by JS series (or TypeScript)
- **Unit tests** ??
- **Integration tests** ??
- **Applied Statistics (basics)** ??
- **Applied Linear Algebra (basics)** ??

## Extracted to separate series

- **Asynchronisity** 100%
- **Static Typing** 60%
- **Functional Programming** 60%
- **__all competent topics__** 40%
- **__all expert topics__** 60%
