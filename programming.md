## Programming I (Beginner)

### Includes

1. **Intro.** Calculations. Practise math functions and operators.

2. **Variables.** Get a concept. Practise more realistic calculations.

3. **Booleans.** Practise arguably the most characteristic programming type.

4. **Conditions.** Boolean-based statements & expressions. Practise and compare different conditionals.

5. **Collections.** Compound values. Practise arrays and objects and compare them.

6. **Loops.** Collection-related statements. Practise and compare different loops.

7. **Strings.** Another collection type. Use conditions and loops to handle strings.

8. **Functions.** The most important software abstraction. Practise all of the above.

9. **Immutability.** In contrast to Mutability. Yield first patterns and "best practices".

### Excludes

- **Types:** highly language-specific, need another course series as JS does not fit
- **Scoping:** later, basic scoping is given in Functions, advanced â€“ togeher with Closures
- **Recursions:** later, not necessary from the start in JS
- **Regular expressions:** later, not necessary, can copy-paste for a while
- **Binary numbers:** later, not necessary for beginners (really!)
- **Statements and expressions:** later, too formal
- **Map / Filter / Reduce:** later, too advanced
