# Readme

Put your project files here. For example, my JS-based project has:

```
content/      -- the content goes here
ignore/       -- stuff I want to git-ignore goes here
node_modules/ -- NPM dependencies
.gitignore
package.json
```

Each language/platform has its own naming conventions so the only required thing is the `content` folder.

Current theme/tutorial structure represents an initial idea that each author will curate a single theme.
That will likely change so tutorials will probably get themeID reference (in YAML) and will probably
lose initial number (in folder name). It will be trivial to update and no bigger structural changes
are planned so far ;)
