Async programming is a paradigm of concurrency (recall Parallel or Distributed programming).
Asynchronicity evolves around tools and approaches to deal with a composition of events and
non-blocking IO operations in a single-threaded languages like JavaScript. You have to know async
programming no matter what path in JS universe you take. Frontend, Backend, and even JS-based GameDev
rely heavily on those skills (or Reactivity which is a further step). Besides practicality, async
tasks will typically decide an interview. Don't skip this topic.
